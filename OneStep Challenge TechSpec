1. Executive Overview
The One Step Challenge is Doji Funding's flagship evaluation product targeting flexible traders seeking an optimal balance between risk and reward. It features a single evaluation phase with fully customizable parameters, adaptive rules, and transparent risk-based pricing.
1.1 Target Audience
Intermediate to advanced traders who want speed and flexibility. The single-phase evaluation reduces time-to-funding to 5-10 days while maintaining robust risk controls.
1.2 Key Differentiators
Single Phase Evaluation: One target to hit, one set of rules to follow. No Phase 2 complexity.
Full Parameter Customization: Profit target, loss limits, split, days, consistency - all adjustable with real-time price recalculation.
Adaptive Rule Engine: News trading, weekend holding, and copy trading permissions adapt automatically based on the chosen configuration.
Risk-Based Pricing: Easier configurations cost more; harder ones cost less. The price always reflects the firm's actual risk exposure.
Promo Code Support: Percentage or fixed-amount discount codes with a floor at 30% of base price to prevent abuse.
2. Account Configuration
2.1 Available Account Sizes
Twenty account tiers from $5,000 to $100,000 in $5,000 increments:

Account Size	Base Price	Price / $1K Capital

2.2 Customizable Parameters
Every parameter below can be adjusted by the trader at purchase time. Each adjustment modifies the final price.

Parameter	Range	Default	Step
Profit Target	5% - 15%	10%	1%
Daily Loss Limit	2% - 8%	5%	1%
Maximum Loss Limit	4% - 12%	8%	1%
Profit Split	50% - 90%	80%	5%
Min Trading Days	3 - 10 days	5 days	1 day
Consistency Rule	10% - 50%	30%	10%
Payout Frequency	Monthly / Bi-Weekly / Weekly	Bi-Weekly	N/A
Daily Loss Calc Type	Intraday / EOD / Static	Intraday	N/A
Max Loss Calc Type	Intraday / EOD / Static	Intraday	N/A

2.3 Loss Calculation Types
Intraday (Cheapest): Real-time balance/equity tracking. Loss limits are monitored tick-by-tick during open market hours. Any breach triggers immediate account suspension.
End of Day (Standard): Loss limits are evaluated at market close only. Intraday drawdowns are ignored as long as the account recovers by session end. Baseline pricing with no adjustment.
Static (Premium): Fixed at start-of-day balance for daily loss, or initial account balance for max loss. Offers a predictable fixed reference point. Most expensive option.

PRICING IMPACT: Intraday saves -$15 per loss type (daily and max calculated separately). Static adds +$25 per loss type. End of Day is the baseline with no adjustment.

2.4 Optional Add-Ons
Add-On	Price	Description
Overnight Holding	+$19	Allows holding positions through daily market close into the next session
Overweek Holding	+$29	Allows holding positions through the weekend. Enforces minimum 5 trading days.

OVERWEEK CONSTRAINT: Enabling Overweek Holding automatically sets the minimum trading days to 5 if currently lower. This cannot be reduced while Overweek is active.

2.5 Payout Frequency Pricing
Payout frequency is a monetized parameter. Faster payout cycles carry an additional fee:

Frequency	Additional Cost	Description
Monthly	$0 (included)	Standard payout cycle, no additional cost
Bi-Weekly	+$29	Payouts every two weeks
Weekly	+$59	Fastest payout cycle, premium pricing

WEEKLY PAYOUT CONSTRAINT: Selecting Weekly payout frequency caps the consistency rule at 30% maximum, regardless of the slider position.
 
3. Pricing Engine
3.1 Pricing Formula
The final price is computed as:

FINAL PRICE = max(
  Base Price
  + Difficulty Adj
  + Split Adj
  + Options Adj
  + Loss Type Adj
  + Equal Loss Surcharge
  + Payout Frequency Adj,
  Base Price x 0.5
)

// With promo code applied:
PROMO PRICE = max(FINAL PRICE - Promo Discount, Base Price x 0.3)

The floor price is 50% of the base price for the standard total. When a promo code is applied, the absolute floor is 30% of the base price to prevent abuse.
3.2 Difficulty Adjustment Rules
Difficulty adjustments reflect how easy or hard the configuration is relative to the firm's default risk profile. Easier configs cost more.

Condition	Adjustment	Direction	Logic
Profit Target < 10%	+$20 per 1% below 10%	Price increases	Lower target = easier to pass
Profit Target > 12%	-$15 per 1% above 12%	Price decreases	Higher target = harder to pass
Daily Loss > 5%	+$60 per 1% above 5%	Price increases	Wider daily buffer = easier
Daily Loss < 4%	-$30 per 1% below 4%	Price decreases	Tighter daily = harder
Max Loss > 8%	+$50 per 1% above 8%	Price increases	More room = less breach risk
Max Loss < 6%	-$25 per 1% below 6%	Price decreases	Less room = higher breach risk
Min Days < 5	+$15 per day below 5	Price increases	Fewer days = less data = riskier
Consistency < 40%	-$2 per % below 40%	Price decreases	Looser consistency
Consistency > 40%	+$2 per % above 40%	Price increases	Stricter consistency
3.3 Split Adjustment
The profit split adjustment is linear:

splitAdjustment = (split - 70) * $4

Examples:
  Split 50% => (50 - 70) * 4 = -$80
  Split 70% => (70 - 70) * 4 = $0
  Split 80% => (80 - 70) * 4 = +$40
  Split 90% => (90 - 70) * 4 = +$80

NOTE: The split adjustment baseline is 70%, meaning a 70% split adds $0. The simulator range is 50-90%.
3.4 Loss Type Adjustment
Each loss type (daily and max) is priced independently:

Loss Calc Type	Daily Loss Adj	Max Loss Adj	Combined Range
Intraday	-$15	-$15	-$30 (cheapest)
End of Day	$0	$0	$0 (baseline)
Static	+$25	+$25	+$50 (premium)
3.5 Equal Loss Surcharge
When Daily Loss equals Max Loss (e.g., both set to 5%), the daily loss protection is effectively removed. A flat surcharge of +$100 is applied to compensate for the increased risk.

WARNING: Daily Loss = Max Loss removes the daily loss safety net. The +$100 surcharge applies on top of all other adjustments.
3.6 Payout Frequency Adjustment
Added to the total price based on the selected payout frequency:

payoutAdj = { monthly: $0, biweekly: +$29, weekly: +$59 }
3.7 Promo Code System
Promo codes apply a discount to the final calculated price. Two types are supported:

Type	Behavior	Example
Percentage	Discount = FINAL * (percent / 100)	DOJI20: 20% off $300 = -$60
Fixed Amount	Discount = fixed dollar amount	TRADER50: flat $50 off

promoDiscount = (type === 'percent') ? total * value / 100 : fixedValue
promoFinal = max(total - promoDiscount, basePrice * 0.3)

// Floor: 30% of base price prevents excessive discounting

4. Risk Score System
4.1 Risk Score Formula
The risk score quantifies how favorable the configuration is for the trader relative to the firm's risk exposure:

riskScore = (profitTarget / 100) * (profitSplit / 100)
           / ((dailyLoss / 100) * (maxLoss / 100))

// Loss type multipliers:
if (dailyLossType === 'eod')      riskScore *= 0.85
if (maxLossType === 'eod')        riskScore *= 0.85
if (dailyLossType === 'intraday') riskScore *= 1.10
if (maxLossType === 'intraday')   riskScore *= 1.10

NOTE: The simulator risk score formula does not include minDays in the denominator, unlike the original spec. The formula uses only target, split, dailyLoss, and maxLoss with loss type multipliers.
4.2 Risk Score Thresholds
Score Range	Risk Level	Actions
< 0.5	Critical	Enhanced monitoring, reduce daily limits by 20%, manual review
0.5 - 0.8	High Risk	Aggressive configuration warning, increased monitoring
0.8 - 1.5	Medium Risk	Standard operations, balanced configuration
> 1.5	Low Risk	Conservative config, enable fast payouts, scaling +2x
4.3 Protection Level Mapping
Risk Score	Protection Level	Firm Response
< 0.7	Maximum	All kill switches active, most restrictive monitoring
0.7 - 1.3	High	Standard protection suite, normal operations
> 1.3	Moderate	Relaxed monitoring, trader-friendly features enabled
5. Adaptive Rules Engine
5.1 News Trading
Condition: Allowed if Profit Target > 8%. If target is 8% or below, news trading is forbidden.
Additional restriction: If Daily Loss > 5%, a 5-minute buffer is enforced around high-impact news events.
5.2 Weekend Holding
Condition: Allowed if Minimum Trading Days >= 5. If min days < 5, all positions must be closed before Friday market close.
Overweek interaction: Enabling Overweek Holding forces min days to 5, which automatically enables weekend holding eligibility.
5.3 Copy Trading
Allowed with verification. Traders must declare their copy trading source, subject to correlation analysis.
5.4 EA/Bots
Expert Advisors and automated trading bots are allowed, except High-Frequency Trading (HFT) strategies (50+ orders/minute or latency-arbitrage).
5.5 Consistency Rule
No single trading day's profit can exceed X% of the total profit (where X is the configured consistency percentage). This prevents lucky trading and ensures repeatable performance.

Range: 10% - 50% (default: 30%).
Weekly payout constraint: If payout frequency is set to Weekly, the consistency rule is capped at 30% maximum.
5.6 Minimum Performance Thresholds
Metric	Minimum Required	Purpose
Sharpe Ratio	0.5	Risk-adjusted return quality
Win Rate	30%	Basic profitability filter
Total Trades	4 x Min Trading Days	Activity and data sufficiency
6. Payout System
6.1 Payout Eligibility
Parameter	Value
Minimum Profit for Payout	2% of account balance
Payout Frequencies Available	Monthly ($0) / Bi-Weekly (+$29) / Weekly (+$59)
Maximum Scaling	5x after validation
6.2 Payout Velocity Control
maxMonthlyPayout = accountSize * (1 / riskScore) * 0.2

Example: $50K account, Risk Score 1.0
Max monthly payout = $50,000 * (1/1.0) * 0.2 = $10,000
6.3 Progressive Configuration Lock
Milestone	Customizable Options	Additional Restrictions
Pre-Payout	100%	None
After 1st Payout	75%	Max daily loss reduced by 1% from original config
After 3rd Payout	50%	Profit target and consistency rule locked permanently
