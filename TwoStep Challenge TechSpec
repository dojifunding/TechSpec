1. Executive Overview
The Two Step Challenge is Doji Funding's classic evaluation product featuring a dual-phase approach that provides the firmest trader validation. With two separate profit targets spread across two phases, it offers maximum freedoms and the highest scaling potential at 10x.
1.1 Target Audience
All trader levels, from beginners seeking a structured evaluation path to professionals who want the highest possible scaling ceiling and maximum trading freedoms.
1.2 Key Differentiators vs One Step
Dual-Phase Validation: Two separate targets provide a double filter, significantly reducing the firm's risk exposure.
Maximum Freedoms: News trading allowed, all EA types permitted, copy trading unrestricted, all instruments available.
10x Scaling Potential: Highest scaling ceiling of any Doji product (vs 5x for One Step, 2x for Instant).
Lower Base Pricing at Scale: At $100K, the Two Step costs $399 vs $499 for One Step.
Minimum 1% Payout Threshold: Most accessible payout requirement of any product.
Promo Code Support: Percentage or fixed-amount discount codes with a floor at 30% of base price.
2. Dual-Phase Architecture
2.1 Phase Structure
The evaluation is split into two sequential phases. The trader must pass Phase 1 before entering Phase 2. Both phases share the same risk parameters but have independent profit targets.

Attribute	Phase 1	Phase 2
Profit Target Range	5% - 12%	3% - 8%
Default Target	8%	5%
Min Trading Days	60% of total days	40% of total days
Risk Parameters	Shared with Phase 2	Same as Phase 1
Account Reset	N/A	Balance reset to initial if Phase 1 passed

IMPORTANT: Min trading days are split 60/40 between Phase 1 and Phase 2. Example: 10 total min days = Phase 1 requires 6 days, Phase 2 requires 4 days.
2.2 Phase Transition Logic
// Phase 1 -> Phase 2 transition
if (phase1.profitReached && phase1.minDaysMet
    && phase1.consistencyPassed && phase1.noBreaches) {
  account.balance = account.initialBalance; // Reset
  account.phase = 2;
  account.phase2StartDate = NOW();
}

// Phase 2 -> Funded transition
if (phase2.profitReached && phase2.minDaysMet
    && phase2.consistencyPassed && phase2.noBreaches) {
  account.status = 'FUNDED';
  account.fundedDate = NOW();
  enablePayoutSystem(account);
}
3. Account Configuration
3.1 Available Account Sizes & Base Prices
Account Size	Base Price	Price / $1K	vs One Step
$5,000	$69	$13.80	+$30 vs 1-Step
$10,000	$89	$8.90	+$30 vs 1-Step
$15,000	$109	$7.27	+$30 vs 1-Step
$20,000	$129	$6.45	+$30 vs 1-Step
$25,000	$149	$5.96	+$30 vs 1-Step
$30,000	$169	$5.63	+$30 vs 1-Step
$35,000	$189	$5.40	+$30 vs 1-Step
$40,000	$209	$5.22	+$30 vs 1-Step
$45,000	$229	$5.09	+$30 vs 1-Step
$50,000	$249	$4.98	Same as 1-Step
$55,000	$279	$5.07	Same as 1-Step
$60,000	$309	$5.15	Same as 1-Step
$65,000	$329	$5.06	-$10 vs 1-Step
$70,000	$349	$4.99	-$20 vs 1-Step
$75,000	$369	$4.92	-$30 vs 1-Step
$80,000	$379	$4.74	-$50 vs 1-Step
$85,000	$389	$4.58	-$70 vs 1-Step
$90,000	$394	$4.38	-$85 vs 1-Step
$95,000	$397	$4.18	-$92 vs 1-Step
$100,000	$399	$3.99	-$100 vs 1-Step

PRICING INSIGHT: The Two Step becomes progressively cheaper than One Step above $60K because the dual-phase filter dramatically reduces the firm's risk with larger accounts.
3.2 Customizable Parameters
Parameter	Range	Default	Step
Phase 1 Profit Target	5% - 12%	8%	1%
Phase 2 Profit Target	3% - 8%	5%	1%
Daily Loss Limit	3% - 8%	5%	1%
Maximum Loss Limit	6% - 15%	10%	1%
Profit Split	70% - 90%	80%	5%
Min Trading Days (Total)	5 - 20 days	10 days	1 day
Consistency Rule	10% - 50%	30%	10%
Payout Frequency	Monthly / Bi-Weekly / Weekly	Bi-Weekly	N/A
Daily Loss Calc Type	Intraday / EOD / Static	Intraday	N/A
Max Loss Calc Type	Intraday / EOD / Static	Intraday	N/A
3.3 Loss Calculation Types
Intraday (Cheapest): Real-time tick-by-tick monitoring. Breach = immediate suspension. Applies identically to both phases.
End of Day (Standard): Limits evaluated only at market close. Intraday fluctuations ignored. Baseline pricing.
Static (Premium): Daily loss fixed at start-of-day balance; max loss fixed at initial account balance. Most expensive option.
3.4 Loss Type Pricing (Two Step Specific)
Loss Calc Type	Daily Loss Adj	Max Loss Adj	Combined Range
Intraday	-$19	-$19	-$38 (cheapest)
End of Day	$0	$0	$0 (baseline)
Static	+$29	+$29	+$58 (premium)

NOTE: Two Step loss type adjustments are larger than One Step (-$19 vs -$15 for intraday, +$29 vs +$25 for static) because the dual-phase structure amplifies the impact over a longer evaluation period.
3.5 Optional Add-Ons
Add-On	Price	Description	vs One Step
Overnight Holding	+$25	Hold through daily close	+$6 vs 1-Step ($19)
Overweek Holding	+$39	Hold through weekends. Enforces min 5 days.	+$10 vs 1-Step ($29)

OVERWEEK CONSTRAINT: Enabling Overweek Holding automatically sets the minimum trading days to 5 if currently lower.
3.6 Payout Frequency Pricing
Payout frequency is a monetized parameter:

Frequency	Additional Cost	Description
Monthly	$0 (included)	Standard payout cycle, no additional cost
Bi-Weekly	+$29	Payouts every two weeks
Weekly	+$59	Fastest payout cycle, premium pricing

WEEKLY PAYOUT CONSTRAINT: Weekly payout caps the consistency rule at 30% maximum.
 
4. Pricing Engine
4.1 Pricing Formula
The formula is identical in structure to One Step, but with different coefficients:

FINAL = max(
  Base + Difficulty + Split + Options + LossType
  + EqualLossSurcharge + PayoutFreqAdj,
  Base * 0.5
)

// With promo code:
PROMO PRICE = max(FINAL - PromoDiscount, Base * 0.3)
4.2 Difficulty Adjustment Rules
The combined target (Phase 1 + Phase 2) is used for target-based adjustments:

Condition	Adjustment	Direction	Logic
Combined Target < 10%	+$15 per 1% below 10%	Price increases	Lower total target = easier
Combined Target > 12%	-$10 per 1% above 12%	Price decreases	Higher total target = harder
Daily Loss > 5%	+$50 per 1% above 5%	Price increases	Wider daily = more forgiving
Daily Loss < 5%	-$25 per 1% below 5%	Price decreases	Tighter daily = stricter
Max Loss > 10%	+$45 per 1% above 10%	Price increases	More drawdown room
Max Loss < 10%	-$20 per 1% below 10%	Price decreases	Less room = harder
Min Days < 10	+$10 per day below 10	Price increases	Fewer days = less validation
Consistency < 45%	-$3 per % below 45%	Price decreases	Looser consistency
Consistency > 45%	+$3 per % above 45%	Price increases	Stricter consistency
4.3 Split Adjustment
The split adjustment baseline for Two Step is 80% (vs 70% for One Step):

splitAdjustment = (split - 80) * $6

Examples:
  Split 70% => (70 - 80) * 6 = -$60
  Split 80% => (80 - 80) * 6 = $0
  Split 85% => (85 - 80) * 6 = +$30
  Split 90% => (90 - 80) * 6 = +$60

NOTE: The per-percent rate is $6 for Two Step vs $4 for One Step.
4.4 Equal Loss Surcharge
When Daily Loss equals Max Loss, a flat surcharge of +$100 is applied (same as One Step).
4.5 Payout Frequency Adjustment
payoutAdj = { monthly: $0, biweekly: +$29, weekly: +$59 }
4.6 Promo Code System
Identical to One Step. Percentage or fixed-amount discounts. Floor at 30% of base price.

promoDiscount = (type === 'percent') ? total * value / 100 : fixedValue
promoFinal = max(total - promoDiscount, basePrice * 0.3)

5. Risk Score System
5.1 Risk Score Formula (Two Step)
The Two Step formula accounts for the dual-phase structure by averaging the targets:

riskScore = ((target1 + target2) / 200) * (split / 100)
           / ((dailyLoss / 100) * (maxLoss / 100))

// Loss type multipliers (same as One Step):
if (dailyLossType === 'eod')      riskScore *= 0.85
if (maxLossType === 'eod')        riskScore *= 0.85
if (dailyLossType === 'intraday') riskScore *= 1.10
if (maxLossType === 'intraday')   riskScore *= 1.10

NOTE: The simulator formula does not include minDays in the denominator. Only target, split, dailyLoss, maxLoss with loss type multipliers.
5.2 Risk Score Thresholds & Actions
Score Range	Risk Level	Protection	Actions
< 0.5	Critical	Maximum	Enhanced monitoring, daily limits -20%, manual review
0.5 - 0.8	High	Maximum	Aggressive config warning, extra monitoring
0.8 - 1.5	Medium	High	Standard operations
> 1.5	Low	Moderate	Fast payouts, scaling +2x bonus
6. Trading Rules & Freedoms
6.1 Maximum Freedoms
The Two Step Challenge offers the most permissive trading environment:

Feature	Status	Conditions
News Trading	ALLOWED	5-minute buffer if daily loss > 5% AND config is flagged as risky
Weekend Holding	ALLOWED	No restrictions (unlike One Step which requires min days >= 5)
EA / Bots	ALLOWED	All types including semi-HFT; only pure latency-arb blocked
Copy Trading	ALLOWED	No verification required (unlike One Step)
All Instruments	ALLOWED	Forex, indices, commodities, crypto, metals
Hedging	ALLOWED	Both intra-account and cross-account hedging permitted
6.2 Consistency Rule
Applied identically to each phase independently. No single trading day's profit can exceed X% of that phase's total profit.
Range: 10% - 50% (default: 30%). Weekly payout caps at 30%.
6.3 Minimum Performance Thresholds
Metric	Min Required	Applied Per
Sharpe Ratio	0.5	Each phase independently
Win Rate	30%	Each phase independently
Total Trades	4 x Phase Min Days	Each phase independently
7. Payout & Scaling System
7.1 Payout Parameters
Parameter	Two Step Value	vs One Step
Minimum Profit for Payout	1% of account balance	More accessible (vs 2%)
Payout Frequencies	Monthly ($0) / Bi-Weekly (+$29) / Weekly (+$59)	Same pricing
Maximum Scaling	10x after validation	2x higher (vs 5x)
7.2 Payout Velocity Control
maxMonthlyPayout = accountSize * (1 / riskScore) * 0.2

// With 10x scaling, the effective max is much higher:
// $100K account scaled to $1M, Risk Score 1.2:
// Max = $1,000,000 * (1/1.2) * 0.2 = $166,667/month
7.3 Scaling Milestones
Milestone	Scale Factor	Account Size ($100K base)	Requirements
Initial Funded	1x	$100,000	Pass Phase 1 + Phase 2
After 1st month	1.5x	$150,000	Positive P&L, no breaches
After 3 months	2.5x	$250,000	Consistent profitability
After 6 months	5x	$500,000	Risk score > 1.0, low drawdown
After 12 months	10x	$1,000,000	Elite trader status
7.4 Progressive Configuration Lock
Milestone	Customizable Options	Locked Parameters
Pre-Payout	100%	None
After 1st Payout	75%	Max daily loss reduced by 1%
After 3rd Payout	50%	Both profit targets + consistency locked
